This is the First Controlling Modality.
This node makes the robot autonomously reach a x,y position inserted by the user. 
The robot can reach the user's x,y coordinates thanks to the 'move_base' action server. 
The robot is going to plan the path through the Dijkstra's algorithm.
The desired x, y coordinates are ROS parameters too and they are set by the :mod:`UI` node.
