.. moduleauthor:: Francesco Pagano <francescopagano1999@outlook.it>

Subscribes to:
    /scan

Publishes to:
    /cmd_vel

This is the Third Controlling Modality.
This node reads inputs from the keyboard and makes the robot navigate in the environment with an obstacle avoidance algorithm. 
Messages of type Twist() are published to the '/cmd_vel' topic. 

The functionality is quite similar to the teleop_twist_keyboad's one.
